# shared-revenue
This is an analysis of WI shared revenue by county.  Report is published [here](https://mjzenz.github.io/shared-revenue/Shared_Rev_Report.html).

All report code is located in [Shared_Rev_Report.qmd](Shared_Rev_Report.qmd). [County population, area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Wisconsin), and [2020 Trump vote proportions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Wisconsin) are scraped from Wikipedia; county shared revenue and tax data come from a [WI Legislative Fiscal Bureau report prepared at the request of Representative Francesca Hong](Documents/TotalSharedRevenue_Tax_2020.pdf) that I have transcribed into the csv file [Shared_Rev_Data.csv](Shared_Rev_Data.csv).
