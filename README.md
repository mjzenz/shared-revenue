# shared-revenue
This is an analysis of WI shared revenue by county.  Report is published [here](https://mjzenz.github.io/shared-revenue/Shared_Rev_Report.html).

All report code is located in [Shared_Rev_Report.qmd](Shared_Rev_Report.qmd). Data comes from scraped wikiepedia page (for county population, area, and 2020 Trump vote proportions), and a [WI Legislative Fiscal Bureau report prepared at the request of Representative Francesca Hong](Documents/TotalSharedRevenue_Tax_2020.pdf) that I have transcribed into the csv file [Shared_Rev_Data.csv](Shared_Rev_Data.csv). 

Feel free to use the reformated data or code from this report, but please provide attribution and refer to the license in this repository.
