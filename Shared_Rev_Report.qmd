During the spring and summer of 2023 leaders in the Wisconsin legislature along with Governor Evers proposed changes to county and municipal aid, which is a small part of the total state tax proceeds shared with local governments.[^1] This "shared revenue" is collected primarily through state income and sales taxes and are redistributed to county and municipal governments to help them fund the various services that are typically provided by local rather than state government.

[^1]: For information about state aid see a recent [WI Legislative Fiscal Bureau Report](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/misc/118_distributions_of_existing_and_supplemental_county_and_municipal_aid_7_10_23.pdf) on changes to state aid to counties. However this is a small fraction of all shared revenue. For instance, state aid to Dane County governments was set to increase from around \$1M to \$5M in 2024, whereas total shared revenue in 2020-21 was around \$250M.

Despite [a complex formula](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2017/0018_shared_revenue_program_informational_paper_18.pdf) for calculating the level of shared revenue, **population largely determines the level of shared revenue that each county receives**.

```{r, population_graph}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false


ggplot(data = data, aes(x = log(Population), y = log(`Total Shared Revenue`))) + 
            geom_point(aes(color = `2020 Trump Majority`)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) + 
  geom_abline(slope = slope, intercept = intercept) + 
  labs(title = "WI County (and municipal) Shared Revenue by Population",
       x = "Population (log)", y = "Shared Revenue in $ (log)") +
theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x =element_blank() , 
        axis.text.y = element_blank() , 
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

Individuals are given roughly equal allocations regardless of where they live, but this can result in local governments receiving proportionally less money in shared revenue than their residents pay in. Richer countries tend to receive less than they pay in, and poorer counties more.

Because of the patterns of wealth in Wisconsin, tax proceeds from richer (primarily suburban) counties generally flow to poorer ones. Additionally, less dense counties recieve less per-capita shared revenue than denser ones, with the exception of Milwaukee County.

```{r, density}



#linear model of density and  per capita shared revenue
density.percapita.combinedtax.lm <- lm(log((`Total Shared Revenue`)/Population) ~ log(`Density (pop sq mi)`), data = data)
#summary(density.percapita.combinedtax.lm)
intercept <- coef(density.percapita.combinedtax.lm)[1]
slope <- coef(density.percapita.combinedtax.lm)[2]
